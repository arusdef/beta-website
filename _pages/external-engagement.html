				<p>The NGO Secretariat is proactive in supporting NGOs to engage in policy debates, formulate advocacy on key humanitarian and development issues and strengthen coordination between Juba-regional-international advocacy networks.</p>
 
				<p>Prior to the reporting period, external representation of the policy and advocacy office focused on external representation in South Sudan on key operational issues but also representation on humanitarian issues in relevant capitals. Operational advocacy focused on ensuring that the humanitarian system was fit for purpose and accessible to NGO needs, as well as humanitarian leadership. However following the passing of the NGO Act and RRC Act 2016 the NGO Forum has come under increasing pressure and restriction from the government of South Sudan which has included a declaration by the RRC that the NGO Forum is an illegal entity which has constrained the NGO Forum’s ability to advocacy regarding issues related to the regulatory framework. Recognising the challenges this may impose on the NGO Forum’s ability to monitor the regulatory framework and beau acratic impediments faced by NGOs, the steering committees in collaboration with UNOCHA and DRC rechannelled the advocacy function of the NGO Forum through the newly created position, Humanitarian Affairs officer/Access (NGO Focal point) who has reporting lines to both UNOCHA and the NGO Forum joint steering committee.</p>

				<p>The position is held by Mz Gaele Chojnowicz who sits in OCHA Juba office. The position ensures that NGO Forum members continue to receive advice on how to navigate the increasingly complex operating environment.</p>
