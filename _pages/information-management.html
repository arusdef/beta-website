            <p>To reach their maximum collective potential, the efforts of the diverse range of NGOs that are operational in South Sudan must be effectively coordinated. With regard to effective humanitarian response, the importance of coordinated action is explicitly recognised in the Humanitarian Reform agenda. The NGO Secretariat plays a functional facilitative role in strengthening NGO access to critical information for programmatic, operational and strategic decision-making; supporting networking between NGOs; and encouraging the development of common positions to enhance overall NGO operational engagement in the country.</p>
