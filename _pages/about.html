				<h2>NGO Forum Approach</h2>

				<p>The NGO Forum provides a platform through which NGOs, the Government of South Sudan (GRSS), the UN, donors, and other external stakeholders can exchange information, share expertise and establish guidelines for a more networked, efficient and effective use of aid resources in South Sudan. The Secretariat primarily focuses on information sharing, networking, representation and communication around safety and wellbeing.</p>
				
				<h2>NGO Forum</h2>

				<p>The NGO Forum was established in Nairobi in the early 1990â€™s as a coordination mechanism for NGOs under OLS. After the signing of the CPA in 2005, many organisations relocated South Sudan offices from Nairobi to Juba in 2006, and the NGO Forum began to meet monthly growing to include a wider number of INGOs and NNGOs. The Forum was created to discuss issues around programming, humanitarian financing, delivery of humanitarian aid, and access. It was established as a voluntary body that operated by a Terms of Reference with an annually elected Steering Committee (SC) of twelve NGOs; (10 INGO and 2 NNGO seats). The NGO Forum has either observer or full member status on the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), the Security Management Team (SMT), and all pooled funding Steering Committees.
				</p>
				<p>
				In mid-2008 a Secretariat was established to facilitate the work of the Forum and Steering Committee. The Secretariat was funded by DFID, later ECHO and has been funded by SIDA and SDC to support coordination, information-sharing and messaging for all NGOs in South Sudan. The Secretariat provides external stakeholders a first point of contact for inquiries on NGO activity. The NGO Secretariat is hosted by Concern Worldwide, while the National and International NGO Steering Committee provide oversight to the operations of the Secretariat and Forum. Every Steering Committee comprises 10 elected members. </p>

				<p>The Secretariat is comprised of an NGO Secretariat Coordinator, Information Manager, Security Focal Point, Security Analyst, Policy Advisor, National NGO Focal Point, NNGO Information Manager, Administrative Officers and drivers who facilitate the work of the Forum on a full-time basis.</p>

				<p>The Secretariat Office is located at {{ site.data.global.address }}</p>
