		The Security Office of the NGO Forum routinely and regularly: provides members with various written information products; conducts information, coordination and assistance meetings, briefings and workshops; maintains security liaison with, and is the primary security point of contact for, other non-NGO groups and individuals; promotes best security practices; facilitates security training and education opportunities; and assists and advises on member preparedness and security incidents/crisis management if appropriate. <strong>The office does not, however, provide security management or an operational presence in any form.</strong>
